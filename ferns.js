        description: 'The sword fern plant is a lush, evergreen ground cover known for its bright green, sword-shaped fronds. Youâ€™ll find the young fronds, or fiddleheads, appearing in early spring from their underground rhizomes with most plants eventually reaching 4 to 6 feet (1 to 2 m.) long. In addition to spreading through rhizomes, sword ferns will also reproduce via spores that are found along the backside of the fronds. These spores appear as brown spots, which are clustered together in groups.',

        description: 'Gymnocarpium dryopteris has small, delicate fronds up to 40 cm (16 inches) long, with ternately-compound pinnae (leaves). Fronds occur singly. On the underside of matured pinnae the naked sori can be found (the Latin generic name gymnocarpium means "with naked fruit"). The species grows in coniferous woodlands and on shale talus slopes. Gymnocarpium dryopteris, a forest understory plant, is not found in association with Quercus (oak).',

        description: 'Christmas fern has a tufted, clumping habit, with its fronds arising from a central growth point. It can form colonies, but frequently grows singly or in twos or threes.[4] In winter, the fertile fronds die; the sterile fronds remain through the winter, and are often flattened to the ground by low temperatures and snow cover. The frond is supported by a dark brown- to black-colored stipe, or stem, which is typically a quarter to a third of the overall frond length. Coarse, light-brown-to-tan scales cover the stipe, and are typically about 5 mm long and translucent. The coiled, developing fronds ("crosiers") are scaly, greyish and prominent in early spring.',
